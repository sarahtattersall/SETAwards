\subsection{Cyclic dependencies}
A cyclic dependency arises when a set of packages depend on each other making it impossible to import them independently. Cyclic dependencies are considered bad practice in software engineering because they introduce a tight coupling between the packages making them difficult to re-use or modify~\cite{whats_wrong_with_circular_references}.


A structural analysis of PIPE 4 was performed by the Stan4J standalone tool. It reports cyclic dependencies as tangles and considers a tangle to be `A subgraph with at least two nodes, where each node is reachable from each other. Every cycle lies in a tangle and every tangle consists of just cycles'~\cite{stan_whitepaper}. It reports PIPE 4 as 29.17\% tangled which can be seen diagrammatically in~\cref{fig:tangle}.

% Ideally PIPE should have as few tangles as possible.
