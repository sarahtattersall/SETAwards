\subsection{General code quality}
In modern day programming it is considered good practice for classes and methods to be short, composed of auxiliary methods and to have a single purpose~\cite{so_can_a_function_be_too_short}. Unfortunately PIPE 4 has many large classes, some with over \num{3000} lines of code. Even the shorter classes do not adhere to good coding practices as can be seen in ~\cref{lst:identical}.
