\section{Analysing the pre-existing PIPE codebase}
The pre-existing release of PIPE is known as PIPE 4 and was released in 2013. Whilst the graphical user interface (GUI), seen in \cref{fig:edit}, is easy to use the underlying architecture is bloated and riddled with bugs.

Using static analysis tools we performed a quantitative analysis of the codebase; the  results are documented below.
