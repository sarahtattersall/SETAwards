\section{Analysing the pre-existing PIPE codebase}
At the time of starting this project PIPE 4 was the latest release of the software. This version currently has over 90,000 downloads to date. Whilst the graphical user interface (GUI), seen in \cref{fig:edit}, is easy to use the underlying architecture is bloated and riddled with bugs.

Using static analysis tools we performed a quantitative analysis of the codebase; the  results are documented below.
