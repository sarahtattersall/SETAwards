% \subsection{Individual areas of concern}
% Beyond the general issues flagged by our static analysis, there were several individual areas of concern for the project which have been outlined below.
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Global State} -- PIPE 4 suffered from several classes which had a global state. In modern day programming having a global state is generally considered to be harmful to application design~\cite{singleton_blog} as its use causes APIs to lie about their true dependencies~\cite{singleton_liars}. This design greatly hinders the learning curve of the project and makes unit-testing very difficult and unreliable because static classes and methods affect the behaviour across every single test.
