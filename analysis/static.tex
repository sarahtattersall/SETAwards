\subsection{Static analysis}
Installing and running the QAPlug plug-in for IntelliJ with the FindBugs, Checkstyle, PMD, and Hammurapi plug-ins found a total of \num{12904} code quality issues. The metrics chosen for this analysis were hand picked to avoid conflicting messages and to provide information about interesting problems.
These metrics helped to identify areas that needed serious improvement and a further selection of the quality issues highlighted by the plug-in can be seen in \cref{fig:qaplug}.
