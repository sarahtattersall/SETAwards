\caption{Break down of issues highlighted by the QAPlug analysis plug-in for Intellij for
each of the new PIPE 5 repositories. The total number of code quality issues for the entire project has been reduced from \num{12904} to \num{937}. Of these \num{937} issues \num{349} are due to auto-generated code via the ANTLR v4 plug-in.
On analysing these code quality issues we found that \num{349} of them are due to the ANTLR v4 auto-generated code meaning that the number of code quality issues for our written code is actually \num{588}. 
Of the remaining issues in the view codebase a total of \num{473} come from the \textit{`Magic Number Count'} metric. These are entirely due to layout and sizing settings for view components and indicate that whilst a useful metric for non-view code it is perhaps not so relevant for projects containing GUI code.
