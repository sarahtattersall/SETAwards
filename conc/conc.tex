\section{Conclusion}
To conclude we have developed a robust, reliable and powerful platform upon which future generations of researchers can use and extend. The following testimonial from Steve Doubleday a researcher at University of California Irvine, who works closely with scientists at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI), summaries the key architectural achievements of this project:

    \textit{``PIPE has been re-engineered top to bottom, as part of its most significant upgrade in years. Key improvements are the separation of business logic from the GUI, the addition of a large suite of unit tests, and the re-packaging of the software as Maven artifacts.  All of this makes my work significantly easier. The work at ICSI (International Computer Science Institute), and my own dissertation both rely on extensions to the basic PetriNet capabilities, to better enable the creation of neurally-plausible cognitive models of action. The existing ICSI software consists of many modifications to a very old version of PIPE. My intent is to re-build the existing ICSI software on top of the new PIPE artifacts. This will make both current development and future maintenance much cleaner, and will also make it more attractive to other cognitive scientists to re-use the ICSI extensions.''}
