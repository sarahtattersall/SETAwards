\section{What is a Petri net?}
A Stochastic Petri net,  as seen in \cref{tikz:photo}, is a bipartite graph made up of places, timed transitions, arcs and tokens. The main strengths of Petri nets in comparison to other formalisms are their convenient graphical representation and their natural expressions of synchronisation. They can be mathematically analysed to yield useful information about a system such as the percentage of time spent in each state.

 Interesting applications include the modelling of computer virus life cycles~\cite{kotenko2005analyzing}, modelling information flow in security policies to determine the possible ways in which information may be compromised~\cite{varadharajan1990petri} and modelling of extreme unforeseen events, such as very heavy rainfall at water sewage plants which can lead to waste water overflowing~\cite{ghasemieh2013analysis}.
