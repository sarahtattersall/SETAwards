Stochastic Petri nets are a high-level formalism for modelling and analysing the behaviour of complex concurrent systems.
The Platform Independent Petri net Editor (PIPE) is an open-source tool for building and evaluating them. Since 2003 features have been added to PIPE by many contributors with a general lack of consideration for the quality of the software engineering and the impact on the correctness of other features. This project presents a complete renewal of PIPE's underlying software architecture as well as new analysis modules which exploit the features of multi-core processors to achieve over 300x speedups.
