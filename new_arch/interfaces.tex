\subsection{Modelling the internal components}
The first step in developing a new back-end for PIPE was to define a set of interfaces that depict a Petri net's internal components, seen in \cref{lst:petri_net_components_uml}. Interfaces were used to make the code extendible for future use. Furthermore in order to aid the design of the core Petri net structure we made use of several design patterns such as the acyclic visitor and builder patterns.
