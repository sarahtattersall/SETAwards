% \subsection{Modelling the internal components}
We began by defining a set of interfaces that depict a Petri net's internal components (see \cref{lst:petri_net_components_uml}).  Furthermore in order to aid the design of the core Petri net structure we made use of several design patterns such as the acyclic visitor and builder patterns.
