\section{Multi-threaded analysis modules}
PIPE 5 supports new implementations of the state space exploration and steady state solver modules. These modules calculate the different possible allocation of resources within the system (also known as states), the percentage time spent in each state at equilibrium and other useful metrics such as the average number of tokens within a place.
